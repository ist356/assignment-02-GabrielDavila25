## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

I wonâ€™t lie, I had to refresh my memory on how to parse and work with lists, which initially felt frustrating, but jogging my memory turned out to be really helpful. This assignment highlighted some areas I need to focus on, especially practicing coding and problem-solving more regularly. One of the main challenges I faced was simply getting started, just figuring out where to begin was overwhelming. I kept second-guessing myself, which made me hesitate. However, once I got the ball rolling and broke the problem down into smaller steps, things became a lot more straightforward. Another issue I ran into was understanding how to properly extract and manage data from strings. At first, the logic behind splitting strings into meaningful parts felt confusing, but as I worked through the examples, it started to make more sense. This experience has shown me that while I can struggle with the initial approach, with more consistent practice, I'll improve my problem-solving process and confidence in tackling new coding tasks.
